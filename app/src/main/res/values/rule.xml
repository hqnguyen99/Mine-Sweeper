        "The objective of this game is to find all the bombs/mines located
        in the 2d grid. Once a cell is clicked, it will either display a bomb
        if it exists in the cell, or it will display a number that indicates
        the number of bombs in the whole row and column. Try to get the least amount
        of scans while locating all the bombs to win the game! Good luck!"
